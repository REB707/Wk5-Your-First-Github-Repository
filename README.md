# Wk5-Your First Github Repository
 Test_Repo
CIS-024 Python Programming Sample Repository
You can put anything in this README file, it doesn't matter, but in your main branch, there should be only one file "README.md"

You should have at least one more branch, which contains one of your weekly assignment

week_1
week_2
week_3
week_4
Bascially all you need to do is just to copy & paste them from Replit to Github

For exmaple, if you chose to upload your first week's assginment, I'm expecting seeing a branch named week_1, and in your week_1 branch, I should see...
README.md
main.py (can be in any name, but it should contain your week 1 assignment code ONLY)
